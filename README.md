# MOD 2 Portfolio Porject:
## Description:
I created a portfolio webpage using ReactJS. We are close to bootcamp graduation and it is time for us to build a webpage to showcase our projects.

General Website functionality:
This website uses two APIs, one is to get the city/state location of the user with their IP address and that information is used to fetch weather data from a weather API. The portfolio website main page starts with the about me introuduction. About page has a button which leads to the adjacent Projects page. Project page will have clickable thumbnails that leads to individual project pages. A dropdown menu component is shared across the the pages.  


Wireframing:

## Future work:
* Update the project page with the projects I want to showcase
* Create back button for individual project pages
* Map through the project data instead of created template pages for them.

## APIs References:
IP Geolocation API: https://ipinfo.io/
Weather API: https://www.weatherapi.com/
